# TromboneChampSongDownloader

To use simply download the Trombone Champ custom songs list at
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xpoUnHdSJFqOQEK_637-HCECYtJsgK91oY4dRuDMtik/edit#gid=282769985
and save as a csv file.
Put in the same folder as the executable or python script and run

NOTE:
Only downloads discord attachments! Not any from MEGA or google drive (sorry but I havn't taken the time to add that yet)
It can also only unpackage archive formats that are either zip or tar (limitation of the shutil module)

With this in mind it can download roughly 70% of all available custom songs which is good enough for me personally since I only spent like an hour or two on this project anyway
